## 📌 Overview

Feature Engineering is the secret weapon in machine learning success. A well-crafted feature can turn a mediocre model into a high performer.  
In this session, we explore:
- What makes a feature powerful?
- Techniques for encoding, transformation, and interaction
- Automating feature engineering
- Tools like FeatureTools, Sklearn Pipelines, and TSFEL

## 🎯 Key Concepts

| Concept                      | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Feature Transformation**  | Scaling, log-transform, polynomial, Box-Cox, etc. |
| **Encoding Categorical**    | One-hot, label encoding, frequency encoding |
| **Datetime Decomposition**  | Extracting hour, day, month, is_weekend, etc. |
| **Binning/Bucketing**       | Grouping continuous features into bins |
| **Interaction Features**    | Creating cross terms or ratios |
| **Missing Value Handling**  | Imputation strategies for robustness |
| **Feature Selection**       | Using correlation, chi-square, SHAP |
| **AutoFE Libraries**        | FeatureTools, tsfresh, autofeat, etc. |
