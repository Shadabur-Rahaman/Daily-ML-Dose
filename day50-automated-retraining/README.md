# 🔄 Day 50 – Automated Model Retraining  
> Building self-improving ML systems with scheduled & event-based retraining.  
📅 #DailyMLDose

---

## 📌 Overview

Once deployed, ML models start losing accuracy over time due to **data drift** and **concept drift**.  
Automated retraining ensures models stay relevant by regularly updating them with fresh data.  
In this session, we explore:
- When and why to retrain a model
- Scheduled vs. event-triggered retraining
- Retraining pipelines with CI/CD
- Tools like Airflow, MLflow, and Kubeflow Pipelines

## 🎯 Key Concepts

| Concept                         | Description |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| **Retraining Triggers**         | Scheduled (e.g., weekly) or event-driven (e.g., drift threshold crossed) |
| **Data Versioning**             | Storing snapshots of datasets for reproducibility |
| **Pipeline Orchestration**      | Automating retraining workflows with Airflow or Kubeflow |
| **Model Registry**              | Tracking versions of models using MLflow or SageMaker Registry |
| **Validation Gates**            | Ensuring retrained models pass accuracy thresholds before deployment |
| **Canary Deployment**           | Deploying new models to a subset of users for testing |
| **Rollback Mechanism**          | Reverting to previous stable versions if retraining fails |

File Description
retrain_pipeline.py Builds and runs full retraining process
event_trigger.py Listens for drift metrics and triggers retraining
model_versioning.py Handles dataset and model versioning
validation_gate.py Tests model performance before deployment
deployment_handler.py Manages deployment and rollback logic

🧪 Sample Snippet

```python
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from retrain_pipeline import run_retraining

with DAG('model_retraining', start_date=datetime(2025, 8, 1), schedule_interval='@weekly') as dag:
    retrain_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='retrain_model',
        python_callable=run_retraining
    )
```
