# 🧩 Day 17 – Ensemble Learning: Bagging vs Boosting

Welcome to **Day 17** of #DailyMLDose!

Today we’re diving into a powerful technique that boosts accuracy and reduces overfitting — **Ensemble Learning**.

## 📌 What is Ensemble Learning?

**Ensemble Learning** combines predictions from multiple models to produce a **more accurate and robust** result than a single model.

There are two key types:
- **Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating)
- **Boosting** (Sequential Correction)

## 🧠 Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

🔹 Trains multiple base learners **in parallel**  
🔹 Each learner gets a **random sample with replacement**  
🔹 Final output is **majority vote** (classification) or **average** (regression)  
🔹 Example: **Random Forest**

## 🔥 Boosting

🔸 Trains base learners **sequentially**  
🔸 Each new model **focuses on previous errors**  
🔸 Final output is **weighted sum of weak learners**  
🔸 Example: **AdaBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting**

|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Training Style    | Parallel                        | Sequential                       |
| Focus             | Reduce variance                 | Reduce bias                      |
| Data Sampling     | With replacement                | Weighted samples                 |
| Model Strength    | Strong from weak learners       | Strong by error correction       |
| Overfitting       | Less prone                      | More prone (can be controlled)   |
| Examples          | Random Forest                   | AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM      |

## 💡 Real-World Analogy

- **Bagging**: Multiple students take a test independently. Their average answer is the final output.  
- **Boosting**: Each student learns from the mistakes of the previous one — correcting errors step-by-step.

## 🧪 Python Code Demo

See [`ensemble_bagging_boosting_demo.py`](code/ensemble_bagging_boosting_demo.py) for examples using:

- `RandomForestClassifier` (Bagging)
- `AdaBoostClassifier` (Boosting)
- `GradientBoostingClassifier`
