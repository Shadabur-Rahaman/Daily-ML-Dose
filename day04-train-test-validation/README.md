# 🧪 Day 4 – Train-Test Split & Validation Strategies

Welcome to **Day 4** of #DailyMLDose!

Today’s focus: **How to properly evaluate your machine learning model** using **train-test split** and **validation strategies**.

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Evaluating on the same data you train on gives *overly optimistic results* — and risks overfitting.  
To truly measure generalization, we use:

- **Train/Test Split**
- **Hold-Out Validation**
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**
- **Stratified Splits** (for imbalanced data)

## 🔍 Train-Test Split Basics

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```
test_size=0.2: 80% training, 20% testing

random_state: for reproducibility

📊 Visual:

🧪 Validation Techniques Overview
Strategy	Description	Best For
Hold-Out	Single train/val/test split	Simple/large datasets
K-Fold	Divide into k parts, rotate folds	Small to medium datasets
Stratified K-Fold	Ensures class distribution remains balanced	Imbalanced classification tasks
Leave-One-Out (LOO)	Each sample used once as a test set	Tiny datasets, high variance

📊 Summary Table:

🧠 Real-World Analogy
Think of validation like rehearsing before a final performance — you need test runs (validation sets) to gauge performance before facing the real audience (test set).

🔑 Best Practices
Always keep a final test set untouched until the very end

Use cross-validation during model selection & hyperparameter tuning

For classification, stratify splits to maintain label balance
